Project Description: The NYUAD Campus Life Website aimed to serve as an online platform that provides comprehensive information and resources to students regarding various aspects of campus life. It aimed to offer a one-stop hub for students to explore and engage in a wide range of campus activities, services, and opportunities.

Overall Concept and Theme: The concept behind the NYUAD Campus Life Website was to create a user-friendly and informative platform that reflected the vibrant and diverse nature of campus life. The theme revolved around promoting accessibility, engagement, and community-building within the NYUAD student body.

Experience Strived to Create: The goal was to create an immersive online experience that not only informed students about campus events, clubs, and services but also facilitated their active participation and involvement. The website aimed to foster a sense of belonging, encourage exploration of diverse interests, and provide avenues for personal and academic growth.

Process: The implementation of the concept involved a collaborative approach between the project team, web developers, and student representatives. The project team conducted extensive research to gather relevant information about campus life, including events, organizations, facilities, and support services. This information was then organized and presented in a user-friendly manner on the website. User feedback was continuously collected and incorporated to ensure the website met the needs and expectations of the student community.

Reflection/Evaluation: The final working version of the NYUAD Campus Life Website successfully achieved its intended goals. It provides students with a centralized platform to access up-to-date information about campus activities and services. The website facilitated engagement and participation, allowing students to connect with like-minded individuals, join clubs, and explore new opportunities. On the other hand, I wanted the website to look more aesthetic. Overall, the website effectively served as a valuable resource for students to enhance their campus life experience at NYUAD.
